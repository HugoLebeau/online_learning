# A random matrix analysis of data stream clustering
This is the companion GitHub repository for our ICML'22 article "A random matrix analysis of data stream clustering: coping with limited memory resources" by Hugo Lebeau, Romain Couillet and Florent Chatelain.

The python script `online_utils.py` contains all the useful functions to reproduce our results.

`VGG` features of randomly-generated BigGAN images can be computed using the scripts in the `data` folder.

The Jupyter notebook `figures_ICML_2022.ipynb` replicates the figures shown in the paper. Simulations can be reproduced with the `Streaming*.ipynb` notebooks.
